			üçæ Short message in the bottle. This is just a CRUD demo app, with no styling. Want to mention
			that almost every lib and tool used in this project - I used for the first time. Exept Svelte
			itself. So everything that implemented is not that pretty and likely could be done better, but
			it's a matter of practice anyway. Overall - to make the interface user friendly won't be a
			problem, it just will take some extra time, and I simply don't know how much time do I have))
			If I have some - please let me know.
		</p>
		<p>
			About forms. I used Shadcn Form + Superform validation here only in one case - editing
			username. Other form actions that implemented I believe will be just fine with what Svelte
			already has. I'd like to extend the user schema and keep on experimenting with validations and
			stuff, but again, matter of time.
		</p>
		<p>
			To test the app - just add random users (or seed them), add random workspaces and just click
			around. It's rather intuitive here)

			Your assignment is to use all the libraries and tools already set up in this project to build
			a simple user management interface. You can use the table above as a starting point, but you
			are encouraged to start from scratch, as long as you follow the requirements below:

			<ul class="mt-4 list-disc space-y-2 pl-4">
				<li>
					<span class="font-semibold">CRUD</span> - You should be able to create, read, update, and delete
					models specified in the schema below, ideally across different routes and pages designed for
					listing, viewing, and updating.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class="font-semibold">Forms</span> - You should use Shadcn
					<a
						class="underline underline-offset-2"
						target="_blank"
						href="https://shadcn-svelte.com/docs/components/form">Form</a
					>
					components alongside
					<a class="underline underline-offset-2" target="_blank" href="https://superforms.rocks/"
						>Superforms</a
					> to implement your forms and validation. You are generally encouraged to use as many Shadcn
					components as you see fit to build out the interface.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class="font-semibold">Schema</span> - You are expected to modify the Prisma schema
					and add your own migrations to support the following domain models (you can use the
					<code class="text-sm">`npm run migrate`</code> command to apply your changes):
					<ul class="mt-2 list-disc space-y-2 pl-4">
						<li>
							<span class="font-medium">User</span> - Represents users in the system. A simple starting
							schema is provided for you, but you should expand it as needed.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="font-medium">Workspace</span> - Represents a workspace that groups users together.
							A user can belong to multiple workspaces. This is a lot like Slack.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class="font-semibold">Styling</span> - You should use a combination of Shadcn and Tailwind
					CSS to style your components. Put some thought into the design, layout, and navigation of your
					pages.
				</li>
			</ul>
